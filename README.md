üßæ Serverless OCR Document Processor with AWS
This project provides a fully serverless Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline built entirely with AWS services and deployed using CloudFormation. It automates the extraction of text from documents uploaded to an S3 bucket using Amazon Textract, stores the extracted content in DynamoDB, and delivers a summary of the results via email using Amazon SES‚Äîall orchestrated through AWS Lambda.
This solution is ideal for anyone looking to build document automation workflows, enhance AI-driven processes, or explore practical serverless architectures on AWS.
‚ú® Features
 * Automated OCR: Automatically extracts text from uploaded PDF, PNG, and JPG documents.
 * Scalable & Serverless: Leverages AWS Lambda and S3 for a highly scalable, pay-as-you-go architecture.
 * Persistent Storage: Stores all extracted text in Amazon DynamoDB for easy retrieval and querying.
 * Email Notifications: Sends an email summary of the extracted text via Amazon SES.
 * Infrastructure as Code: Deploys the entire solution using a single CloudFormation template, ensuring repeatable and consistent deployments.
 * Real-time Monitoring: Integrates with CloudWatch for comprehensive logging and monitoring of the entire pipeline.
üöÄ Tech Stack
 * Amazon S3: Stores uploaded documents (PDF, PNG, JPG) and acts as the trigger source.
 * AWS Lambda: Executes the core OCR processing logic, triggered by S3 upload events.
 * Amazon Textract: The powerful OCR service that performs intelligent text extraction from documents.
 * Amazon DynamoDB: A NoSQL database used to persist the extracted textual content under a unique documentId.
 * Amazon SES: Sends extracted text summaries and notifications to a verified email address.
 * AWS CloudFormation: Defines and deploys all necessary AWS resources as a single, cohesive stack.
 * AWS CloudWatch: Provides logging and monitoring for all service interactions within the pipeline.

‚öô How It Works
 * Document Upload: A user uploads a supported document (.pdf, .png, or .jpg) to the designated S3 input bucket.
 * Lambda Trigger: The S3 upload event automatically triggers an AWS Lambda function.
 * Textract Processing: The Lambda function invokes Amazon Textract to perform asynchronous text extraction on the uploaded document.
 * Data Storage: Once Textract completes the extraction, the Lambda function stores the extracted text content in an Amazon DynamoDB table, indexed by a unique documentId.
 * Email Notification: Simultaneously, a summary of the extracted text (or the full text, depending on configuration) is sent via email using Amazon SES to a pre-configured recipient.
 * Logging: AWS CloudWatch captures detailed logs of every step of the execution lifecycle, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
üîê Prerequisites
Before deploying this project, ensure you have the following:
 * An AWS Account.
 * AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.
 * Your AWS account must be in Amazon SES sandbox mode, and you need at least one verified email address in SES. This email will be used as both the sender and recipient for notifications.
 * Sufficient IAM permissions to deploy CloudFormation stacks and create/manage S3 buckets, Lambda functions, Textract, DynamoDB, and SES resources.
üì¶ Deploy This Project
Follow these steps to deploy the serverless OCR processor to your AWS account:
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

 * Review and customize template.yaml (Optional):
   You might want to adjust resource names, S3 bucket names, or other parameters within the template.yaml file to suit your preferences.
 * Deploy via AWS CLI:
   Execute the following command from your terminal. Replace you@example.com with your verified SES email address.
   aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file template.yaml \
  --stack-name Serverless-OCR-Processor \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides SenderEmail=you@example.com RecipientEmail=you@example.com

   * --template-file template.yaml: Specifies the CloudFormation template to deploy.
   * --stack-name Serverless-OCR-Processor: Sets a name for your CloudFormation stack.
   * --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM: Acknowledges that the template creates IAM roles.
   * --parameter-overrides SenderEmail=<your-email> RecipientEmail=<your-email>: Passes the required email addresses to the CloudFormation stack.
 * Wait for Deployment: The deployment process will take a few minutes. You can monitor its progress in the AWS CloudFormation console.
 * Test the Pipeline: Once the stack is deployed, locate the S3 input bucket created by the stack (its name will be visible in the CloudFormation Outputs or S3 console). Upload a test .pdf, .png, or .jpg file to this bucket.
 * Check Your Inbox: Watch your inbox for an email containing the extracted text results! ‚úâ

‚úÖ Project Status & Future Enhancements
This project is currently:
 * ‚úÖ Fully functional and deployed: Provides a robust serverless OCR solution.
 * üí° Great for: Document automation, AI workflows, serverless demos, and personal learning.
Potential Future Enhancements:
 * Frontend UI: Develop a simple web interface for easy document uploads and viewing extracted results.
 * Support for More Formats: Expand support to include other document types (e.g., TIFF, DOCX).
 * Advanced Text Processing: Integrate with NLP services (e.g., Amazon Comprehend) for sentiment analysis or key phrase extraction.
 * Error Handling & Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs): Implement more robust error handling and DLQs for failed Lambda invocations.
 * Cost Optimization: Implement lifecycle policies on S3 to manage storage costs.
 * Asynchronous OCR Job Status: Implement a mechanism to check the status of long-running Textract analysis jobs.
